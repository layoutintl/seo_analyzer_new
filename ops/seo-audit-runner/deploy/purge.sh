# purge.sh — EXPLICIT state destruction (contract §8). Never part of
# uninstall, upgrade, or any automated flow.
#
# Requires BOTH:
#   --yes-delete-state              the unambiguous confirmation flag
#   --final-backup-to <dir>         an operator-named location that receives
#                                   a final state backup BEFORE deletion
#
# Deletes (only after the final backup succeeds AND is verified): the state
# directory including backups/, the configuration directory (runner.env!),
# and the log directory. The seo-runner user is kept unless --delete-user
# is given. Refuses to run while the runner is active.
#
# Deletion-safety contract (deploy/path-safety.sh):
#   - Production targets are the fixed approved paths ONLY. Environment
#     variables are never honored to redirect a deletion target (purge
#     refuses to run at all when SEO_AUDIT_RUNNER_STATE_DIR is set).
#   - --destdir enables the staged test mode: targets are then exactly
#     <validated destdir> + the approved suffixes, nothing else.
#   - Every target is canonicalized, checked against broad/forbidden
#     paths, must contain no symlinked components, must carry a valid
#     runner ownership sentinel, and is re-validated immediately before rm.
#   - The final backup destination must be outside every deletion target.
#   - The final backup archive is VERIFIED before anything is deleted:
#     non-empty, extractable, and the contained database passes
#     PRAGMA quick_check; a machine-readable receipt
#     (<archive>.verify-receipt) is written next to the archive.
#   - If verification cannot be performed, purge fails closed: nothing
#     is deleted.
#
# Staged-test overrides: --destdir; SEO_AUDIT_RUNNER_NODE selects the Node
# binary used for verification (it cannot redirect any deletion target).

Usage: purge.sh --yes-delete-state --final-backup-to <dir> [--delete-user]

Permanently deletes runner state, backups, configuration (runner.env),
and logs — AFTER writing and VERIFYING a final backup in the directory
you name. Run deploy/uninstall.sh first to remove code and units.
