# Troubleshooting — SEO Audit Runner

Work top-down: `doctor` first, then the specific symptom. Nothing in this
document requires codebase knowledge.

```bash
sudo -u seo-runner seo-audit-runner doctor
```

Exit codes: `0` healthy · `2` warnings (degraded but working) · `1` broken.

---

## Installation

**`install.sh: ERROR: a system installation requires root`**
Run with `sudo`. (`--destdir` is only for staged tests, not servers.)

**`no Node.js binary found` / `Node.js <v> is NOT supported`**
Install Node 24 LTS (≥ 22.5.0 minimum), then
`sudo bash deploy/install.sh --node /usr/bin/node` (or wherever node is).
Never upgrade the main application's Node runtime for this.

**`post-install validation failed`**
Run `sudo -u seo-runner seo-audit-runner validate-config` and read the
listed problems — almost always a `runner.env` issue (see next section).

## Configuration

**`NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true requires a Slack delivery method`**
Fill in `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` **and** `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` (channel ID, not
name), or `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — or set `NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false`.

**`SEO_API_BASE_URL points to a public host over plain http`**
The app API is unauthenticated; plain http is allowed only to private
addresses (localhost, 10.x, 192.168.x, VPN/internal names). Use https or
an internal address.

**Permission denied reading runner.env**
```bash
sudo chown root:seo-runner /etc/seo-audit-runner/runner.env
sudo chmod 0640 /etc/seo-audit-runner/runner.env
```

## Execution

**Exit code 4 — `another runner instance is already active`**
Expected overlap protection. `seo-audit-runner health` shows the holder
pid. A lock whose process died is reclaimed automatically on the next
run; no manual cleanup is needed or wanted.

**Exit code 2 — some audits failed/timed out**
`seo-audit-runner status` and the Slack summary list which projects.
Check the application's own health, then retry the affected project.

**Every audit fails with API errors**
`sudo -u seo-runner seo-audit-runner run --all --dry-run` — if this
fails, the app is unreachable from this host: check `SEO_API_BASE_URL`,
firewalls, and that the app is up (`curl -fsS <base-url>/api/health`).

**Job stuck in RUNNING after a crash/reboot**
The next `worker --once` tick (or the tick timer) marks it FAILED
(`interrupted: …`); re-queue with `seo-audit-runner job retry <id>`.

## Scheduling

**Timer enabled but nothing happens**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl list-timers 'seo-*' 'seo-audit-runner*'
journalctl -u seo-audit-runner.service -e
```
Also confirm you did not enable BOTH scheduling models — pick one.

**Schedule exists but no job is created**
`schedule list` — is it `ENABLED`? Is `seo-runner-tick.timer` active?
A `next=` time in the future is normal; occurrences more than 24 h in
the past are deliberately skipped (catch-up window).

**Wrong hour after a DST change**
Schedules follow their stored IANA timezone (`schedule list` shows it);
the systemd daily timer follows `Africa/Cairo` in its `OnCalendar=`. If
you need a different zone: `schedule update <id> --timezone <Area/City>`.

## State database

**`state database check failed` / integrity errors**
1. Stop automation: `sudo systemctl disable --now seo-runner-tick.timer seo-audit-runner.timer`
2. `sudo -u seo-runner seo-audit-runner doctor` (runs PRAGMA quick_check)
3. Restore the newest good backup:
   `sudo -u seo-runner bash deploy/restore.sh --yes /var/lib/seo-audit-runner/backups/state-<stamp>.tar.gz`
4. Losing state is degraded, not fatal: the next run re-reports all
   currently active critical issues once.

**`backup.sh: runner is active and the online backup API is unavailable`**
Wait for the current run to finish (or stop it) and re-run the backup.

## Upgrade / rollback

**Upgrade failed mid-way**
`upgrade.sh` flips `current` back to the previous release automatically
and says so. State was backed up before anything happened. Investigate
with `journalctl` / the printed error, then retry.

**After rollback: `the rolled-back release cannot open the current state database`**
The state schema is newer than the old code. Restore the matching
pre-upgrade backup (`deploy/restore.sh --yes <archive>`) or the
`runner-state.sqlite.backup-v<N>` file the migration left in the state
directory — never delete state to "fix" this.

## Logs

```bash
journalctl -u seo-audit-runner.service -e     # daily audit
journalctl -u seo-runner-tick.service -e      # scheduler tick
journalctl -u seo-runner-retry.service -e     # Slack retry
```
Secrets are redacted by the runner before logging; if you ever see a
credential in any output, treat it as an incident and rotate it.

## Still stuck?

Collect and attach:
```bash
sudo -u seo-runner seo-audit-runner doctor --output json > doctor.json
sudo -u seo-runner seo-audit-runner status --output json > status.json
journalctl -u 'seo-*' --since -2d > journal.txt
```
None of these files contain secrets.
